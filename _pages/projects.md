We are making advances in robotics through two directional approaches: (1) [enabling technology](#category-1-enabling-technology) and (2) [application](#category-2-application).

### Category 1. Enabling Technology
One direction is enabling technology side. This includes how can we build and control robots more systematically and efficiently. This means that, we are focusing on **methods** rather than **specific robots**. From this perspective, we will build a framework that builds with minimized human effort, using computational approaches including AI, optimization, and simulation.

### 1.1. Computational Robot Co-Design

    <h3>Computational Robot Co-Design</h3>
    <p>
      We develop **AI-driven frameworks** for robot body & controller co-design, 
      integrating generative models, physics simulation, and optimization. 
      This approach enables scalable, task-specific robots such as 
      agile legged systems or modular manipulators.

### Category 2. Application 
Another direction is application side. This includes how can we apply robotics to real-world problems, especially in human-centered domains. This means that, we are focusing on **specific robots** rather than **methods**. From this perspective, we will build robots that can assists human beings in our daily life, such as kitchen assistance robot, wearable robots and prosthetics.

### 2.1. Assistive Robotics including Wearable Robots & Prosthetics
<div class="project-card">

  <div class="project-text">
    <h3>Wearable Robots & Prosthetics for Rehabilitation and Assistive Applications</h3>
    <p>
      We design and study **tendon-driven wearable robots and prosthetic devices** 
      to support individuals with motor impairments. Our research spans from 
      lightweight hand exoskeletons to prosthetic hands, focusing on intuitive 
      control, comfort, and daily usability.
