## Overview
We are making advances in robotics through two directional approaches. 

### 1. Enabling Technology
One direction is enabling technology side. This includes how can we build and control robots more systematically and efficiently. This means that, we are focusing on **methods** rather than **specific robots**. From this perspective, we will build a framework that builds with minimized human effort, using computational approaches including AI, optimization, and simulation.

### 2. Application 
Another direction is application side. This includes how can we apply robotics to real-world problems, especially in human-centered domains. This means that, we are focusing on **specific robots** rather than **methods**. From this perspective, we will build robots that can be used in our daily life, such as wearable robots and prosthetics.

## Project Details

### Computational Robot Co-Design

  <div class="project-text">
    <h3>Computational Robot Co-Design</h3>
    <p>
      We develop **AI-driven frameworks** for robot body & controller co-design, 
      integrating generative models, physics simulation, and optimization. 
      This approach enables scalable, task-specific robots such as 
      agile legged systems or modular manipulators.

    <h3>Wearable Robots & Prosthetics for Rehabilitation and Assistive Applications</h3>
    <p>
      We design and study **tendon-driven wearable robots and prosthetic devices** 
      to support individuals with motor impairments. Our research spans from 
      lightweight hand exoskeletons to prosthetic hands, focusing on intuitive 
      control, comfort, and daily usability.
