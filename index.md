# Welcome to the BEAR Lab üêª
At the **Bioinspired Embodied AI and Robotics (BEAR) Lab**, we envision a world where robots and AI serve as agents that support and empower people.


## Research Areas
For more details, see our [Projects](/projects/) page.

1. **Robotics for Human Assistance**  
   We design and build robots that support people in daily life, rehabilitation, and healthcare. Current directions include **wearable robots** for mobility and rehabilitation, as well as **home-assistive robots** that enhance independence and quality of life.

2. **Bioinspired Design**  
   Nature often provides elegant ‚Äúlocal minimum‚Äù solutions to complex engineering challenges. We aim to make bioinspiration more **systematic and computational**, leveraging algorithms and simulations to uncover design principles from biology.

3. **AI for Embodied Robotics**  
   Artificial intelligence‚Äîparticularly **generative AI and physical AI**‚Äîoffers new ways to design and control robots. We study how AI can:  
   - **Design robots** (shaping morphology and mechanisms)  
   - **Control robots** (adapting to uncertain, real-world environments)  
   - **Co-design body and brain** simultaneously, optimizing robots for task-specific performance.
